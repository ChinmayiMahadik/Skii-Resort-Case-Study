# Skii-Resort-Case-Study
Performed EDA and multiple linear regression to find selling price of property

A) For Exploratory Data Analysis using skii-Resort data set

We used packages like tidyverse, funModeling , Hmisc for data summary. For data visualization in form of graphs, we used package call ggplot. We also use Microsoft Excel for interactive graphs.

Process used in EDA:

1) Data cleaning - Finding and handling missing and incorrect data.
2) Handling outliers.
3) Data summarization.
4) Inference from univariant , bivariant and multivariat charts.

B) Creating regresssion models.

We used two methods - stepwise regression and subset linear regression model. After evaluating all assumptions of multiple linear regression we selected best model with high r-square value and accuracy.

We also performed k-fold cross validation to verify if there is not overfiting.
